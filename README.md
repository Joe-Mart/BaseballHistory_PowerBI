# BaseballHistory_PowerBI
Baseball History analyzed in Power BI files

These Power BI files are created based on the Kaggle databank of baseball located at https://www.kaggle.com/open-source-sports/baseball-databank.

The databank contains statistics from 1871 to 2015.

There is also an analysis based on Pandas in Python in the directory https://www.kaggle.com/adamjyu/major-league-pitching-pandas-tutorial-and-eda.

I am taking a class at Code Louisville for the Python part and decided to use this data to create Power BI stuff.

I decided to separate batting and pitching into separate Power BI apps.

The data folder has the csv files that are used in the apps.

When you load the files and data, it is preferred that you bring in the data folder and may have to re-link the data to get it to work.
